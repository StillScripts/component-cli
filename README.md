# Component CLI
Designing this as a CLI tool that can be used to turn HTML templates into React components and, eventually, 
support any framework. 

## Instructions
- Run `yarn install` to install node_modules
- Run `yarn link` to enable local access of component-cli. 
- Run `yarn build` to build the app. 
- Run `component-cli` to generate components in the /components directory 

Currently it must be run in a Unix terminal like Git Bash or a Mac/Linux terminal due to its reliance on chmod
